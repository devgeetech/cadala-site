# Cadala

Cadala plans to help those who are on the dark side of the e-commerce revolution. Equipping manufacturers with the capabilities to tackle the rapidly advancing world and letting the world in on the wonderful array of Indian products are the prime focuses of Cadala.

This repo contains the code for the landing page of the Cadala platform. It was built using Gatsby, Sass and Hasura. Multi-language capability was implemented using the Context API and it is available on mobile-views.

In 2020, the cadala platform was moved to another domain and technology stack. It is now available at https://cadala.in/
